<h2>2. Mysore</h2>
<p>Famously known as The City of Palaces, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that Mysore, currently Mysuru, is one of the most important places in the country regarding ancient reigns. 
It is replete with the history of its dazzling royal heritage, intricate architecture, its famed silk sarees, yoga, and sandalwood, to name just a few. 
Located in the foothills of the Chamundi Hills, Mysore is the third most populated city in Karnataka, and its rich heritage draws millions of tourists all year round. 
The highlight is the majestic Mysore Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is a must-visit.
Mysore was one of the three largest Princely States in the erstwhile British Empire of India. 
To this day, the Mysore Palace stands tall as one of the most spectacular palaces in India. 
A very famous tourist spot that sees thousands of visitors milling in and around it every day, the Mysore Palace is a mesmerizing example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, every inch of the palace drips with opulence and intricate details, and every room that you visit stands out in terms of its elaborate architecture, beautiful paintings, rich colours and stained-glass windows. 
On every Sunday, and during the Dussehra celebrations, the palace is spectacularly lit up once dusk falls.

<h2>3. Hampi</h2>
<p>Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. 
Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. 
The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. 
It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. 
Famous for its massive, beautifully carved temples, especially the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to the patron deity of the empire. 
You can also find remains of the old aqueducts, canals and military barracks and stables here. 
Hampi was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986 and many efforts have been taken to restore the lost glory of the place - very limited (if any) modern establishments are allowed in the main area, which gives an authentic feel to the ruins.

<h2>4. Gokarna</h2>
<p>With its pristine beaches and breathtaking landscapes, Gokarna is a Hindu pilgrimage town in Karnataka and a newly found hub for beach lovers and hippies.

The out-of-town beaches like Kudle beach and Om Beach are a different contrast to life inside the town. 
Palm clad beaches are dotted with foreign tourists in a majority and very few Indians are seen across. 
Gokarna is not very conventionally touristy. 
The beaches are meant for a slow, relaxed holiday and everything on the beach goes at the same relaxed pace. 
Full of coconut and palm trees, the ocean and clean sands, Gokarna is a 'one of a kind' place in the country.

<h2>7. Jog Falls</h2>
<p>The second-highest plunge waterfall in India, Jog Falls is a major tourist attraction in Karnataka and is the highest waterfall in the state. 
Second, to the Nohkalikai Falls of Meghalaya, Jog falls drops about a huge 253 m (850 ft. ) in a single fall. 
However, due to the construction of Linganamakki Dam which is a hydroelectricity plant closeby, the flow in the falls is hugely restricted before monsoons. 
So, it is best to go during the Monsoon season to see the falls in its full form.
Jog Falls is a 2 hours drive from the main Shimoga city. 
Also known as Gerosappa Falls or the Joga Falls, this seasonal waterfall is broken into four segments - Raja, Roarer, Rocket and Rani. 
They're named based on certain characteristics of the streams. 
Raja is an unbroken stream, Roarer is a strong and violent current that gushes down to meet the Raja stream, Rocket flows down in different jets and Rani is a quiet stream with falls in foam. 
Next time you visit, try identifying the streams!
